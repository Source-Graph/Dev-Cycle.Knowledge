# Source-Graph.App
Is both an App and a software development Mangement methodology!
Instead of using Scrum, make a dag Graph of all Features and components in a project! Then assign developers to specific branch and leaf nodes.

## Multiple Layers
Bug reports and Feature requests are also another layer on the graph, viewed as a stack of graphs or multi-dimensional array. This lets your overlay bugs & prospective features 1-1 on tope of the specific areas of Code they are for or caused by!
